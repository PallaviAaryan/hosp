                <p>A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment.
                   The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems
                   ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its 
                   region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialized hospitals include
                   trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific
                   medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories.</p>
                <p>A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses. A medical facility smaller than 
                   a hospital is generally called a clinic. Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care) and specialist units
                   such as cardiology. Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units. Common support units include a 
                   pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.Hospitals are usually funded by the public sector, health organisations (for profit or nonprofit), 
                   health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations. Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded 
                   by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.</p>
